Semester project for the course of ”Advances Topics on Databases” of Data and Web Science MSc in the school of Informatics of the Aristotle University of Thessalonki. In this project I worked with Multimedia Databases. More specifically, I worked with image data and created a content based image search app. The search works with two different ways by using either a color or a shape descriptor. Additionally, I also created a web application for a better management and for a more beautiful environment and so that the whole experience can be accessed more easily through a browser.

For building my app I used python 3.7 and open-cv 4.2, a python library that aids in the processing of images. As database I used the PostgreSQL, also known as Postgres, along with the pgAdmin tool to better manage my database. To create the web app I used Flask, a popular micro web framework written in Python. The web app then is deployed with the usage of Heroku, a cloud application platform and is available for use on the provided. Alternatively, there is also an option for the usage of the app through the console in a simpler way, without the usage of the web framework created but this also requires the creation and population of the database from the beginning. Thus, using the web app is recommended.
